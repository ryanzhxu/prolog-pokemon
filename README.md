### What is the problem?

We'd like to build a BO5 Player vs Computer Pokémon game where each takes turn to cast a move and go against each other using their selected Pokémons.

  - There will be a number of Pokemons for selection.
  - Each Pokemon has
    - its own type, and each type has an advantage on another (i.e. fire > grass > water > fire)
    - 2 attack moves (1 attack and 1 defence)
      - attack moves could be limited with usage. (i.e 1 strong attack with maybe 5 limit usages, and 1 weak attack with 10 limit usage.)
        - special skills (stun, frozen, sleep, etc.)
    - The damage calculations will be based on a number of factors (current health, current status, element, etc.)

### What is the something extra?

  - A recommendation system where system would suggest player to pick a specific Pokemon to go against to other player based on elements counter.
  - We have created a simple GUI using library XPCE. It shows 6 buttons of 6 pokemons. Once clicking the button, a new window showing the information of the corresponding pokemon will pop up.

### What did we learn from doing this?
